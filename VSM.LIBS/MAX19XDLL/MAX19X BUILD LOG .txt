last update 03/12/04 build 9
THIS DLL IS NOW OPEN SOURCE 

MAX19XDLL  
MAX190 CHIP OUTLINE  USES MAX190.MDF MODEL these models inturn use the dll
MAX191 CHIP OUTLINE  USES MAX191.MDF MODEL
MAX19XINTER ISIS PART...   LISA MODEL INTERNAL PART TO ACCESS THE DLL 
THIS PART ALLOWS FOR A VREF ADJUSTMENT CIRCUIT TO BE MADE USING SPICE
AND ATTACHED TO THE DLL AND  ACTUAL ISIS PARTS 
FOR VREF SPICE FUNCTIONS NOT DESERVING HARD CODING IN THE DLL
THIS PART CALLS  EITHER THE 190 OR 191 CLASS
THE 191 HAS AN INTERNAL CLOCK NOMINAL 1MHZ 
{CAP ADJUST NOT HARD CODED ADJUST FROM THE CHIP OUTLINE ISIS MENU{STILL TO IMPLIMENT}}



NEXT FEW DAYS TIME:

++	STILL TO CONSTRUCT SOME TEST DESIGN I STARTED TO DO THIS 
++	ILL ADD NEXT  THE DATA OUTPUT SECTION FOR SERIAL AND PARALLEL BUS DRIVE FUNCTIONS	not started yet
++	ILL ADD THE CHOICES IN SPICE SECTION FOR 190 191 FUNCT  				started
++     	ILL ADD THE SPICE SECTION TILL COMPLETED              					started
++     	ILL ADD THE INTERNAL CLOCK								DONE
++     	ILL START TO ADD DSIM FUNCTIONS AND THE ORDINALS 					DONE


BUILD LOG SO FAR

++	started to complete the serial sections
++	added parallel serial data sections and  bus's 
++      started to complete the spice section still to add 191 or 190 choices for spice events
	as per the datasheet

++ 	added a clock to the model to allow for easier clocking of the a-d
	{will use same amount of cpu anyway and saves the code clutter}
	and if you  set the isis 190 or 191 parts edit menu choice for this internal clock
	to a setting of 0 zero  you wont get any internal clock
	a trade of i know  but a novel solution ..
	.. hence no cap {120pf nominal} is needed to activate the internal clock}
++	COMBINED THE190/1 to one CLASS and  adjusted the model 
	to add the correct split rail supplies 
++      ADDED DATA ORDINALS
++   	ADDED NEW MODELS AND PARTS TO ALLOW 
	FOR THE FULL MODELING FOR THE VREF AND REFADJ SENARIOS  
	TYPICAL TO THESE CHIPS AND MOST OF THE 1XX FAMILY A-D 
	{ILL ADD THE REST OF THE 19X SERIES AS TIME ALLOWS}

+#      FIXED MANY BUILD BUGS IN THE CODE AND ADDED BUSPIN ROUTINES
	THIS UPPER AND LOWER DWORD/CUSTOM BUS SYSTEM LOOKS EASIER TO USE
	FOR  ALL 11 BITS OR IN 8 BIT MODE ETC.. AND FOR A-D PROGRAMMING FROM mcu
	ILL EMPLOY THIS SYSTEM TO THE MAX18X SERIES AS IT REALY IS NEEDED 


MAYBE SOMEONE WANTS SOME EXPERIANCE MAKING A DLL LIKE THE  MAX18X AND 19X IM WRITING SLOWLY,
IT TAKES ME  ABOUT 6 MONTHS  IN ROTATION OF 6 OR SO DLL'S LIKE THIS,
TO EVENTUALY  FINISH A DLL  AND ABOUT 1 YEAR TO TEST AND TWEAK IT. 
SO FAR IVE MADE FOUR SUCH LITTLE FAMILY GROUP'S IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS
AND THERE IS SOME SOURCE ON THE SITE FOR ADC083X FAMILY FROM -EA-
I WILL ADD MORE OF THESE SOURCES WITH TIME 
{FIRST ILL MAKE A GOOD COLLECTION OF UNRELEASED STUFF}
IF YOU WANT MORE SOURCES EMAIL VSMLIBS@YAHOO.CO.UK
AS I HAVE A FEW OF MY OWN I DONT MIND SHARING 
YOU CAN ALSO REQUEST SOURCES AND  MAYBE A LITTLE HELP FROM 
THE OTHER MODEL MAKERS  LIKE ANDREW IN RUSSIA OR EA IN ITALIA 
{LOOK ON THE VSM USERS SITE FOR CONTACT DETAILS}


IF YOU NEED  ONE OF THE CLASS'S  FINISHED QUICKLY THATS WAY DOWN THE LIST 
I DONT MIND TO ADJUST THE PRIORITY OF  WORK SCHEDULE
