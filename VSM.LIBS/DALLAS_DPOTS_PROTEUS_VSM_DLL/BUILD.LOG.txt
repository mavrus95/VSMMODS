I HAVE COMPLETED THE MUX SOUT DATA
BUT I CANT TEST IT IN PIC LAND
TILL I UPGRADE THE PICC DRIVER FOR THIS CHIP 

METHOD

COPY  THE LIBS TO THE LIBRARY THE MODELS TO THE MODELS FOLDER
IN YOUR PROTEUS INSTALATION  

AND RUN THE TEST DESIGN IN the pic design and source code folder
youll find the c code made in picc there also


ill get time to alter the picc driver soon
and add a routine to get the needed extra clocks pulses and the ssb bit 
sent as bit b0 avalible for use...

but if someone see's an easy way to do it ill test the dll further
send to me simeon @ vsmlibs@yahoo.co.uk


INSTALL
-------
MOVE A COPY OF THE MODELS LIBRARYS FOLDERS INTO THE LABCENTER PROTEUS ROOT
C:\Program Files\Labcenter Electronics\Proteus 6 Professional    {OR TO THE LITE PATH}

TO 'ADD' TO THESE FOLDERS or set paths from proteus to this folders models and libarys folders
and save the preferances {also in isis system menu } then restart isis to complete install
you should now be able to place them as chips and run

TYPES ADDITIONS TO DATE
-----------------------

DALLAS TYPE DS1267 {SAME AS 1868 BUT LOW POWER}
DALLAS TYPE DS1666-DS16665  TYPES {UPDOWN TYPES}
DALLAS TYPE DS1804 has nv ram and eeprom saves counter and runs random decider
DALLAS TYPE DS1867 MUCH THE SAME AS 1868 BUT HAS EEPROM PERSISTANT MEMORY
DALLAS TYPE DS1868 completed


VERSION INFO
------------

DALLAS TYPE DS1267 		v1.04
DALLAS TYPE DS1666-DS16665 	v1.04 
DALLAS TYPE DS1804 		v1.04
DALLAS TYPE DS1867 		v1.04
DALLAS TYPE DS1868 		v1.04



Bugs & error's.. Found & Fixed 
-----------------------------
tidy'd and remade libs and models updated designs and models and corrected some wrong values 
still to work a little on the pot tapers 



added the same system to 1867 for eeprom fail
fixed nv save and fail system DS1804I
model now works very well indeed 
taking a random value between 0 and 65535 
adding to the 0xC350 {50000 guaranteed flashes}
each time the simulation is run 
just like a real chip each time its powered the eeprom 
will fail at a different max of flash's amount
removed mangled class names from dll 
updated dll to re-orient classes
tidy libs models designs
rebuilt all models and the dll   
fixed a few of the demo / timing  designs to work
fixed all internal lib parts to call the right models types for some types this was wrong
rebuilt spice sections to optimise 
fixed 1666 end stops {still to add taper resistor...}
reset popup height ds1666
found a syntax error in the pin qualifiers
fixed voltage level on vcc pin triggered save eeprom event for ds1867
improved the timings all over...
compressed the lib to a dallas.dll 
with two models classes inside
the 1267 & 1868 use a common class with only submodel differances
and the DS1267 is a ultra low power type
wrong makers name in copyrights message 
found a timing issue with ssb bit not appearing on cout absmin test
at the right time  this is fixed
found pots not centered properly as per settings of F7 F7
showed a 20R error this is fixed and the vpots now center properly
