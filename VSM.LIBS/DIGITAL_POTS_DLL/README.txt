INTRO
=====
=======================================================
NOTE: NOW USING V6.9 SP4 PIC STARTER KIT FOR ALL BUILDS
=============================================================
THIS DLL IS NOT FINISHED AND HAS A FEW BUGS MAYBE???
JUST FOR VIEWING INTO MY NEW PROJECT ILL NOW CONTINUE WITH
TILL THE END OF SUMMER

==========================================================================

DP_POT.DLL 
---------- 
IS A 16 SELECTABLE POT'S DIGITALY 8 OR UPTO  16 BIT BUS PROGRAMMABLE {FOR NOW}  4-16bit DECODER lengh 
PDRC {PROGRAMMABLE DIGITIZED RESISTANCE CONVERTER}


TO FORM A SELECTABLE SCALABLE DIGITAL POTS ARRAY
WILL ALLOW UP TO 16 POTS BUSABLE PROGRAMMING and eeprom load to all pots 
with separate load and save pins AND SELECTED ENTRY AND RELOAD as well as master reset eeprom

FOR NOW THIS IS ALPHA RELEASE V1.052 DP_POT.DLL

i hope you enjoy trying it out 
and please send any views or if you want something added in 
to vsmvdd@yahoo.co.uk

thanks....


ADDITIONS OF FUNCTIONS 
----------------------

ADDED BETTER RULES FOR GLOBAL INIT + SOME LOGS AND MESSAGES IF YOU MAKE A BOBO IN THE SETTINGS
IF FORINSTANCE YOU CHOOSE 8BIT DECODING AND  THEN SET A HIGHER ORDER INIT OR GLOBAL INIT VAL   
SO IF YOU SET THEM FOR SAY 100HEX  AND  THEN TO 8 BIT DECODING LENGHT 8 BITS MAX IS 0Xff
THIS WILL THROW A LOG ERROR 


BUGS CLOSED
-----------
v1.052
NOW YOU CAN ONLY LOAD NEW DATA USING a clocked  LOAD PIN
METHOD IS HOLD=LOW RESET=LOW CLOCK->POSEDGE LOAD->POSEDGE 
8 OR 16 BUS THEN READS AND SELECTED FIFO FILLS 
SO  THERE IS NO DIRECT CLOCKING IN NOW  YOU MUST CLOCK AND LOAD SAME TIME 
TO GET NEW DATA FROM THE BUS TO THE POTS
 
 
ADDED BETTER RULES TO THE INIT SYSTEM
ADDED BETTER RULES FOR EEPROM SAVES  AND LOADS

NOW YOU CAN ONLY LOAD AND SAVE A SINGLE SELECTED MEMORY 
{PULL THE HOLD PIN HIGH THEN FILL SELECT BUS THEN LOAD OR SAVE THE SELECTED}
IF YOU HOLD{NO LOAD}AND THEN  PULL RESET LOAD AND SAVE HIGH  ALL EEPROM MEMORYS RESET AS WELL AS ALL POTS TO 0X0000
{A KIND OF MASTER RESET EEPROM}


IM JUST GETTING READY TO ADD THE EEPROM PAGE SELECTOR ROUTINE 
MAYBE ILL ADD A PAGE SELECT PIN IE.. PULL IT HIGH WHILE HOLD IS HIGH  
AND IT WILL LOAD THE PAGE SELECTED BY THE SELECTOR BUS 
ILL FIGURE SOMETHING OUT TODAY AND  ADD THIS FOR LATER IN THE WEEK 

NOW BACK TO THE IOMIDIPORT CLASS ADDITIONS TO SLDVDD


WHAT IN THE NEXT RELEASE
=========================
V1.06 ALPHA
 
ILL TRY TO DO SOME WORK 
ON THE SPICE RESISTORS SPARCE MATRIX NEXT
TO ALLOW FOR VARIOUS CALCULATIONS TO BE ADDED 
TO GIVE LOG AND ANTILOG SCALLING


NOTES:
-------
remember that the eeprom data is stored in a file in the designs dir as a .epf file

IF YOU ACTIVTE THE SHUTDOWN SHDN PIN THE STATUS POPUP TEXTS GOES BLACK
L{LOWER RESISTOR} SHORTS TO W {WIPER} 
W GOES OPEN CIRCUIT TO h {HIGER RESISTOR} 

there is a 1 ohm non linearity error in all pots 
i know what this is caused by but however i think this is fine  and accurate enough for now
as the purpose of this design is use in rdac pots models for other chips
and these usualy have K values so 1 ohm isnt a problem 1OHM IS 0.1 % OF 1K
however when i get some time ill rework the sparce matrix to fix this problem } 



======================================================
TO INSTALL MY DLLS AND WORK


I USUALY JUST ADD A PATH TO THE PATHS SECTION
OF THE SYSTEM MENU IN ISIS 
ONE FOR THE MODELS AND ONE FOR THE LIBS
THIS WAY YOUR DEFAULT SETUP DOESNT BECOME POLUTED 
AND SERVICE PAKS FIT NICER WITH OLD VERSIONS 
UPDATES TO MY STUFF ARE THEN EASILY REMOVED AND REPLACED QUICKLY

I HOPE YOU ENJOY VSMLIBS DP_POT.DLL
