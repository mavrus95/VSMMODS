------------------------------------------------------

DETAILED DEVELOPMENT LOG
------------------------
for max 18X series A-D converter dll

WRAPPER COMPLETED
pin statements added 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

class progress
---------------
max 180		shell started
max 181		shell started
max 182		shell started
max 183_4_5 	joint class   : started
max 186_8 	joint class   :in-progress
max 187_189 	joint class   :completed


slowed down on this one as knowone asked for any other classes in a hurry so far
only the max187/189 was needed quick  


4 ++	Started again to rebuild all classes adding buspin implimentations
	for all data bus used.
3 +?  	Decided to make the max 18x classes that use complex referance pin behaviour
	do this spice work from submodel designs much like the max19x dll i started
	take a look its on the c++ coder pages on vsmlibs site's
2 ++    Rebuilt compounded and cleaned the max187/189
1 #     removed a bug in the event sheduling of the max187/9
	now the microwire timings are fully correct

MAYBE SOMEONE WANTS SOME EXPERIANCE MAKING A DLL LIKE THE  MAX18X AND 19X IM WRITING SLOWLY,
IT TAKES ME  ABOUT 6 MONTHS  IN ROTATION OF 6 OR SO DLL'S LIKE THIS,
TO EVENTUALY  FINISH A DLL  AND ABOUT 1 YEAR TO TEST AND TWEAK IT. 
SO FAR IVE MADE FOUR SUCH LITTLE FAMILY GROUP'S IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS
AND THERE IS SOME SOURCE ON THE SITE FOR ADC083X FAMILY FROM -EA-
I WILL ADD MORE OF THESE SOURCES WITH TIME 
{FIRST ILL MAKE A GOOD COLLECTION OF UNRELEASED STUFF}
IF YOU WANT MORE SOURCES EMAIL VSMLIBS@YAHOO.CO.UK
AS I HAVE A FEW OF MY OWN I DONT MIND SHARING 
YOU CAN ALSO REQUEST SOURCES AND  MAYBE A LITTLE HELP FROM 
THE OTHER MODEL MAKERS  LIKE ANDREW IN RUSSIA OR EA IN ITALIA 
{LOOK ON THE VSM USERS SITE FOR CONTACT DETAILS}


IF YOU NEED  ONE OF THE CLASS'S  FINISHED QUICKLY THATS WAY DOWN THE LIST 
I DONT MIND TO ADJUST THE PRIORITY OF  WORK SHEDULE
